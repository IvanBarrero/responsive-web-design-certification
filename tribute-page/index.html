            <h2>Here are some facts about Beethoven's life:</h2>
            <p>Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the greatest music composers of all time. He was also a very good piano
                player ans his improvisation abilities were reknown.</p>

            <p>Beethoven is well known by many music pieces, some of which are very well known in western civilization.
                For example, the <em>Ode to Joy</em> from his 9th Symphony is the basis of the European Union anthem.
            </p>

            <p>Besides his music, Beethoven is an example of hard work and persistence against adversity. When he was
                about 30 years old, his deaf problems started to became notorious. Years later he was completely deaf, a
                limitation too difficult to face by a musician.</p>

            <p>However, Beethoven never stopped his composition work. Some of his greatest works were composed when he
                was completely deaf, like the 9th symphony itself or his late string quartets.</p>
